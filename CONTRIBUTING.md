# Contributing to Buck

We encourage the reporting of issues and bugs, along with pull requests to help make the Buck codebase better. The following are some information and guidelines to help you contribute to Buck.

## Tour of the Codebase

This is a high-level overview of how the Buck repository is organized.

### `docs/`

Buck's public documentation. The docs on https://github.com/facebook/buck are generated from the files in this directory.

### `config/`

This is where configuration files live (currently, this includes only logging configurations).

### `src/`

This is where Buck's Java source code lives.

### `test/`

This is where tests, both unit and integration tests, should go. If an integration test needs to create a sample project to run on, follow the example of creating a testdata directory in the folder where the integration test code lives and putting each sample project in its own subdirectory of testdata. Use com.facebook.buck.testutil.integration.ProjectWorkspace to drive your integration test.

### `testdata/`

This directory is deprecated. See the description of the test/ directory about how to organize test data for new integration tests.

### `third-party/`

This is where third-party dependencies live. These dependencies are organized by programming language.

### `webserver/`

The static content served by Buck's webserver. (See .buckconfig for details.)

## Development Workflow

### Building Buck

As explained in [Downloading and Installing Buck](https://buckbuild.com/setup/install.html), you can build Buck by running ant in the directory where you checked out Buck from GitHub. If you modify Buck's source code, running ant again should be sufficient to rebuild it. If you are concerned that Buck may have gotten in some sort of bad state, run ant clean && ant to do a clean build.

### Running Tests

Buck's tests use JUnit and are under the test subdirectory. Here are some examples for running them with Buck:

- Running all tests: use `buck test`
- Running all tests under specific directory: use `buck test //test/com/facebook/buck/file/...`
- Test a particular Java class: use `buck test --test-selectors NameOfTest`. Wildcards are also possible, e.g. `buck test --test-selectors 'Cxx.*Test'`.
- Faster way of running a specific class: use `buck test --test-selectors RemoteFileTest //test/com/facebook/buck/file:file`
- Keeping tests' files: to avoid auto-deleting temporary directories generated for JUnit tests, use `BUCK_TEST_KEEP_TEMPORARY_PATHS=1 buck (test options...)`

To find out more about testing options refer to an article about [test](https://buckbuild.com/command/test.html) command.

### Building Other Projects With a Development Version of Buck

While you are developing Buck, you should create a `.nobuckcheck` file in the root of the project where you are using Buck. Read the articles on `.nobuckcheck` and `.buckversion` for more details.

### Using the Eclipse IDE

Buck contains the Eclipse project configuration files `.classpath` and `.project` so that Buck can be imported directly into Eclipse as a Java project. The project is configured such that when you save your code, Eclipse automatically overwrites the `.class` files where Buck expects them (assuming you have Build Automatically enabled in Eclipse).

This means that immediately after you save your code in Eclipse, you can switch to the command-line to run buck and you will automatically run Buck with your most recent edits. If your Eclipse build becomes wedged for any reason, selecting the root folder of the Buck project and choosing `File -> Refresh` followed by `Project -> Clean...` should fix everything.

### Using the IntelliJ IDE

Buck also contains the metadata files so that it can be imported as a project in IntelliJ. Developing Buck in IntelliJ works perfectly fine; however, it does not automatically overwrite the existing `.class` files as Eclipse does. (You could likely add some sort of build step to IntelliJ to make this possible, but we have not.) Therefore, if you elect to develop Buck using IntelliJ, you may want to create an alias for buck that runs ant before running Buck to reduce the friction of developing with IntelliJ.

## Code Style

Writing a detailed Java style guide takes a considerable amount of effort, so here are the highlights for what we expect in Buck:

### Spacing

- Spaces only: no tabs.
- Standard indent is 2 spaces; continued lines are indented 4 spaces.
- Lines are a maximum of 100 columns.
- For a method call/declaration, if all params do not fit on one line, then each param should be on its own line.

### Naming

- The use of Hungarian notation in any form is prohibited.
- Prefer descriptive names to single-letter names. The primary exceptions to this rule are (1) the use of `e` for the name of an exception in a `catch` block, and (2) the use of `i` as the - name of an index in a `for` loop.

### Null

- In the spirit of Guava, references are assumed to be non-null unless otherwise noted.
- Non-null parameters should be verified using `Preconditions.checkNotNull()`.
- A nullable reference should be annotated with `@javax.annotation.Nullable`.
- A popular alternative to `@Nullable` is `com.google.common.base.Optional`.
- Annotating an Optional as `@Nullable` is "grounds for dismissal".

### APIs

- Guava should be used liberally.
- In particular, favor Guava's immutable collections. In addition to preventing aliasing bugs, they disallow null as an element, which is in line with the previous bullet point.
- Log only using com.facebook.buck.log.Logger. Do not use java.util.logging.Logger or other logging APIs. See the article on logging for more details.

### Comments

- Comments should be valid US-English sentences: they should start with a capital letter and end with appropriate punctuation.
- One space after a full stop is preferred. This makes it easier to honor the 100 column rule. This may violate what you learned in high school, but browsers have been condensing your two spaces down to one in HTML for years, so you are likely more accustomed to it than you think.
- The specification of a field or member should be documented using Javadoc (i.e., `/** */`) rather than implementation comments (i.e., `//`), even if the field or member is private.
- A Javadoc comment should be preceded by a blank line.

### Imports

- No wildcards in imports.
- Non-`java` imports are listed before `java` imports.
- `java` imports are listed before `javax` imports.
- Files should not contain unnecessary imports. Use your favorite IDE to help you with this.

### Warnings

- Code should compile without warnings. To enforce this, we use a combination of `-Xlint` and `-Werror` flags to `javac` in addition to a number of other static checks provided by PMD.
- Warnings should either be fixed or annotated with `@SuppressWarnings("type-of-warning")`, as appropriate.

## Logging

Buck logs debugging information to `buck-out/log/buck-0.log`. (Older logs are rotated to `buck-out/log/buck-1.log` etc.)

To add more logs to your code, import `com.facebook.buck.log.Logger`, create a static instance, and add your logs:

```java
import com.facebook.buck.log.Logger;

public class MyClass {
  private static final Logger LOG = Logger.get(MyClass.class);

  public doStuff(MyData data) {
    // Supports String.format() formatters.
    LOG.debug("Doing stuff: %s", data);
    try {
      doSomethingThatThrows();
    } catch (IOException e) {
      // Logs a stack trace with a message.
      LOG.error(e, "Couldn't do stuff!");
      throw e;
    }
  }
}
```

Buck's Logger exposes five log levels:

| `com.facebook.buck.log.Logger` | `java.util.logging.Level` equivalent|
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------|
| `error()` | `SEVERE` |
| `warn()` | `WARNING` |
| `info()` | `INFO` |
| `debug()` | `FINE` |
| `verbose()` | `FINER` |

By default, Buck only logs to disk messages at `debug()` level and higher. Feel free to pepper your code with `verbose()` logs and even check them inâ€”they won't have any impact on performance and won't clutter up the logs.

If you want to change the global logging level, edit `config/logging.properties.st` (in the buck repo), `.bucklogging.properties` (in the root of the repo in which you're running buck), or `.bucklogging.local.properties` (same) and specify a `java.util.logging.Level` equivalent to the level you want to log (see the table above):

```
.level=FINER
```

You can also control the level of individual loggers, identified by package or class name:

```
com.facebook.buck.stuff.MyClass.level=FINER
```

Extensive logging can help you get to the bottom of build issues, especially in circumstances where additional information is hard to get, for example in continuous integration builds.

If you notice the logs are getting too big to retain for long periods of time, or for all the builds, you can use the CompressingFileHandler to compress the logs, by configuring it in `.bucklogging.properties`, for example:

```
# Enable the console logging handler and the file handler to
# write rotating log files under buck-out/log/buck-*.log in the
# project(s) being used.
handlers=com.facebook.buck.cli.bootstrapper.ConsoleHandler,com.facebook.buck.cli.bootstrapper.CompressingFileHandler

# Log to buck-out/log/buck-*log.
com.facebook.buck.log.CompressingFileHandler.pattern=buck-out/log/buck-%g.log.gz

# Write to disk all log messages not otherwise filtered by the top-level ".level"
# property.
com.facebook.buck.log.CompressingFileHandler.level=ALL

# Ignore the environment and always write UTF-8 to files.
com.facebook.buck.log.CompressingFileHandler.encoding=UTF-8

# Replace the default fugly multiline log formatter with a custom one.
com.facebook.buck.log.CompressingFileHandler.formatter=com.facebook.buck.cli.bootstrapper.LogFormatter

# Rotate up to this many log files, then start deleting the oldest one.
com.facebook.buck.log.CompressingFileHandler.count=25
```

## Immutable Value Types

Buck makes heavy use of immutable value types (Java objects which only hold final members and contain no business logic). These ease development and testing, as stateful APIs can be rewritten as stateless APIs which accept and return all the value types upon which they need to act.

Traditional Java value types cause two problems:

1. Each value type requires a lot of manually-written boilerplate code, including `equals()`, `toString()`, and `hashCode()`.
1. Value type constructors take large numbers of arguments, causing any change to the value type to necessitate changes in a large number of clients and tests.

To fix both of these issues, we use the `Immutables.org` library automatically generate source code for immutable value types (including implementations for `equals()`, `toString()`, and `hashCode()`) as well as `Builder`s to put together instances of a value type piece by piece.

To use immutable value types in a Buck `java_library`, use the `java_immutables_library` function in your `BUCK` file. For example:

```
java_immutables_library(
  name = 'value',
  srcs = glob(['*.java'])
  deps = [
    '//third-party/java/guava:guava',
  ],
  visibility = ['PUBLIC'],
)
```

Then, declare an interface or abstract class named Abstract* containing the type and data accessors. Make sure to annotate it with `@org.immutables.value.Value.Immutable` and `@com.facebook.buck.util.immutables.BuckStyleImmutable`.

```java
import com.facebook.buck.util.immutables.BuckStyleImmutable;
import com.google.common.base.Optional;
import org.immutables.value.Value;
import java.util.List;

@Value.Immutable
@BuckStyleImmutable
interface AbstractType {
  String getName();
  List<Long> getPhoneNumbers();
  Optional<String> getDescription();
}
```

Note that the `AbstractType` type is package private; the generated class will be named `Type` and will be public.

This will generate two classes:

- `Type`: A concrete, public, final implementation of `AbstractType` with private final members.
- `Type.Builder`: A `Builder` which generates instances of `Type`.

For example, to generate an instance of and check its members in a unit test:

```java
Type t = Type.builder()
  .setName("Jenny")
  .addPhoneNumbers(8675309L)
  .build();

assertEquals("Jenny", t.getName());
assertEquals(ImmutableList.of(8675309L), t.getPhoneNumbers());
assertFalse(t.getDescription().isPresent());
```

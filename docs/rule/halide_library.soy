{param overview}
A halide_library() rule represents a set of Halide sources, along with the "compiler"
code needed to compile them into object format (see <a href="http://halide-lang.org">
the Halide site</a> for information about Halide and about static compilation of
Halide pipelines). The object code will be generated for the target architecture.
{/param}

{param args}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'name' /}
  {param desc}
  The name of the rule.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'srcs' /}
  {param desc}
  The set of halide sources to compile for this rule. The sources will be
  compiled and linked for the host architecture, and the resulting binary will
  be run to produce the object code for the Halide pipeline.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'deps' /}
  {param default: '[]' /}
  {param desc}
  The dependencies of the generated halide pipeline code. This is useful if, for
  exmaple, your pipeline calls an external function using Halide::Func::define_extern.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'compiler_deps' /}
  {param default: '[]' /}
  {param desc}
  The dependencies of the halide compiler itself. Targets that depend on the
  halide_library rule will not include or link the outputs of these targets.

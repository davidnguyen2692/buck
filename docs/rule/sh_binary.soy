{call buck.rule}
{param status: 'UNFROZEN' /}
{param overview}
  A <code>sh_binary()</code> is used to execute a shell script.

{call buck.arg}

  The name of the sh_binary.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'main' /}
  {param desc}
  Either the path to the script (relative to the build file), or a {call buck.build_target /}.
  This file must be executable in order to be run.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'resources' /}
  {param default: '[]' /}
  {param desc}
    A list of files or build rules that this rule requires in order to run. These could be things such as
    random data files.

    These files are made available in a directory at run time and are placed relative to
    their original location in the project repository.

    This directory's location is determined entirely by Buck; the script should not assume the directory's location.
    The location is provided to the script in the <code>$BUCK_PROJECT_ROOT</code> environment variable.
